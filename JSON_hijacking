===============
1.User authenticated to target website ,visit malicious site.the malicious site able to make request to target server bypassing authentication(user is already authenticated) and 

a)Personal data
b)Session Hijacking(stealing authentication token.)
c)API exploitation

h)Extract personally identifiable information(PII)

Steps:
1.The attacker gets an authenticated user to visit a malicious page to read their data.
2.From where we have logged in, the malicious page will try to access the sensitive data by embedding a script tag in an HTML document. i.e.


<script src="http://<jsonsite>/abc.php"></script>

Steps to prevent
=================
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be used for a service to prevent json hijacking.
These vulnerabilities exploit the same-origin policy's (SOP) exceptions for certain types of resource loading, primarily the <script> tag
